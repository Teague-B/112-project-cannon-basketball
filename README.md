Notes
-----------------
This project was originally designed to be able to have a resizable window. However, this caused a lot of problems with making math very
complicated. Because of the level of complication, I dropped support for that. However, there are still a lot of scaling variables and functions
floating around because of the time it would take to convert everything back.
